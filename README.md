* [Data Science Notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook)
  - A tool which runs in Docker which provides an environment for experimenting with Python, R and Julia, with many popular libraries pre-installed.
* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
  - Allows installation and upgrade of many many different versions of Python. Python is the most popular language for data engineering tasks, and many tools are written using it.
